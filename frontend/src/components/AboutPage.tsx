                project that utilises the various NASA and Google Earth Engine
                APIs to present geographical and astronomical data in a clean
                and organised manner. I have spent countless hours (250+) in
                this project to make sure that this Gallery provides a neat and
                beautiful interface for accessing the awesome imagery hosted by
                NASA and Google. This website is fully optimised for desktop,
                laptop and mobile users and has a very intuitive UI.
            </p>

            <p className="project-desc">
                I created this project mainly to showcase my full-stack
                development skills and my experience in working with enterprise
                grade APIs. The front-end is composed of a barebones HTML file
                which is populated through React hydration. I have used
                react-router to manage the client-side navigation so as to
                provide a snappy and seamless UI experience. The backend is
                powered by an Express.js server running on Node.js. All API
                secrets are handled in the backend itself and no secrets data is
                ever leaked to the client.

                This project uses namely the following APIs:

                Working in this project has been an a great learning experience.
                It has given me a deep appreciation for the effort that goes
                into building features we often take for granted on websites,
                such as dark mode and seamless user interfaces. These seemingly
                simple elements are the result of countless hours of dedication
                by multiple developers. I am truly grateful for taking the
                initiative to embark on this journey, as it has taught me
                invaluable lessons. This project marks my first large-scale
                full-stack endeavor, and I am proud of the work Iâ€™ve
                accomplished. This experience has not only refined my skills but
                has also deepened my passion for web development.
