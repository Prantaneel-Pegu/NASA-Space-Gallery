                project that utilises the various NASA and Google Earth Engine
                APIs to present geographical and astronomical data in a clean
                and organised format. I have spent countless hours in this
                project to make sure that this Gallery provides a neat and
                intuitive UI for accessing the awesome imagery hosted by NASA
                and Google.

                I created this project mainly to showcase my full-stack
                development skills and my experience in working with external
                APIs. The front-end is composed of a barebones HTML file which
                is populated through React hydration. I have used react-router
                to manage the client-side navigation. The backend is powered by
                an Express.js server running on Node.js. The backend provides a
                custom API through which the front-end fetches the data.

                Working in this project has been an a great learning experience.
                It has given me a deep appreciation for the effort that goes
                into building features we often take for granted on websites. I
                am truly happy for taking the initiative to start this project,
                as it has taught me invaluable lessons. This was my first
                full-stack project, and I am proud of the work Iâ€™ve done. While
                the website may be a little rough around the edges, especially
                the design part, functionality-wise it is quite robust.
